Since this game is probably never coming back might as well open source.
<br>
Hella scuffed but oh well
# Info
This was for a modding group for Multiverses after the game closed we all kinda quit
<br>
It doesn't have anything major and iirc you can't move ðŸ’€
# Features
Hella shit won't work such as some text replacements but you can look through the maps to play [here](https://github.com/GDBOI101/LunarCore/blob/main/Core.h#L94C5-L111C6)
## Enjoy
